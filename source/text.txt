an import part of the cours and will involv a signific amount of c program you can choos whether you wish to work alon or in team of two howev the two person project will involv proport more work the goal of the project is two fold a to get hand on experi at build some specif dbm compon b to get comfort work with a larg pre exist code base and modifi it in a modular manner the second goal is as import as the first one becaus all databas system are huge softwar system and rare do you have the luxuri of start from scratch thi forc you to write modular code and also to understand the interact between the differ system compon when the inevit bug appear there are two research dbm prototyp that will be use in the project one is minibas which is softwar associ with the textbook it is a simpl singl user databas system that provid all the compon from the sql parser down to the disk manag thi should hope be avail depend on our be abl to compil and run it in our comput environ the import part of minibas is the interfac descript of the variou system compon the actual code come from class project consequ project use minibas will involv write a compon like the buffer manag base on a specif of it c interfac the other prototyp is predat which is a queri process engin that i have been develop for my research there are a number of possibl project some of which could lead to research topic that can be built on top of predat the focu here is on the high end function like complex queri and new data type if you are not familiar with c i recommend a minibas project becaus the amount of design need is minim if you think you are interest in databas system research then you should do a predat project if you fall in neither categori then you should decid whether you want a project at the lower level dbm storag access buffer area or the higher level queri process optim area and choos between minibas lower level and predat higher level there are also some gener project that involv neither system if you have your own idea on a suitabl project you should talk with me about it well in advanc of the project propos date here is a tent list of possibl project in all the project there will be certain step that should be follow as part of the project propos you should discuss with me and submit an order list of piec of function that the project will produc there will be a mid project review

project zeno is build technolog support the storag commun and process of continu media data in contrast to other commerci and research approach which requir special hardwar oper system or network to be usabl all of these technolog we are design fit into the current research environ our premis is that the current hardwar softwar and commun infrastructur is suffici to support research into continu media system and applic we are verifi thi hypothesi by build work system our research on storag system is direct toward build the zeno distribut video file server the zeno architectur use a network of workstat connect by a gener local area network e g an ethernet a common environ in comput research laboratori each workstat can act simultan as both a client and a server of continu media data as a client a workstat play video store on one or more server as a server a workstat is a file server for video data each client can receiv video store at sever server and each server can servic sever

the sequenti of the data and the queri data model the detail of the seq data model are describ in a publish paper click here for postscript version here we present the gist of it the basic model of a sequenc is a set of record map to an order domain of posit thi mani to mani relationship between record and posit can be view in two dual but distinct way as a set of record map to each posit or as a set of posit map to each record these two view are call posit and record orient respect and each give rise to a set of queri oper base on that view queri on sequenc could requir oper of either or both flavor the record orient oper are similar to relat oper and includ variou kind of join overlap contain etc and aggreg such oper have been extens explor by research in the tempor databas commun the posit oper includ next previou offset move aggreg etc further oper allow zoom oper on sequenc by mean of collaps and expand the order domain associ with the sequenc for instanc a daili sequenc could be zoom out i e collaps to a weekli sequenc or zoom in i e expand to an hourli sequenc the last part of the model deal with oper on group i e set of sequenc the advantag is that thi make it easi to

among the research and commerci oodbm commun while the odmg effort ha also concentr on provid some degre of support for languag heterogen which in turn facilit hardwar heterogen shore remain distinguish by it focu on scalabl and support for applic that depend on the unix file system for persist storag furthermor sinc the shore data model sdl is basic compat with the odmg data model odl we expect that much of the technolog that we develop can eventu be transfer to the commerci sector scalabl architectur shore s softwar architectur is uniqu is sever way first shore use a symmetr peer to

singl processor a network of workstat or a larg parallel processor such as the intel paragon or ibm sp thi design is in contrast to the client server architectur use by exodu and all the oodbm vendor while a client server architectur is fine for a design environ such as is typic use in softwar and hardwar cad effort it is not scalabl the second uniqu featur of the shore architectur is it notion of a valu ad server by structur the softwar that run in the server with extens in mind it is rel simpl for user to build applic specif server for exampl the paradis project is alreadi use the shore server to build a geograph inform system for nasa s eosdi project we feel that these two uniqu piec of technolog will play a import role in a varieti of futur research and commerci endeavor for exampl

object share within a larg name space of object support for exist file base applic a major goal of shore is to enabl applic that current use untyp byte orient file for their persist data flatten and

fine needl aspir fna he identifi nine visual assess characterist of an fna sampl which he consid relev to diagnosi in collabor with prof mangasarian and two of hi graduat student rudi setiono and kristin bennett a classifi wa construct use the multisurfac method msm of pattern separ on these nine featur that success diagnos of new case the result data set is well known as the wisconsin breast cancer data the imag analysi work began in with the addit of nick street to the research team the goal wa to diagnos the sampl base on a digit imag of a small section of the fna slide the result of thi research have been consolid into a softwar system known as xcyt which is current use by dr wolberg in hi clinic practic the diagnosi process is now perform as follow an fna is taken from the breast mass thi materi is then mount on a microscop slide and stain to highlight the cellular nuclei a portion of the slide in which the cell are well differenti is then scan use a digit camera and a frame grabber board the user then isol the individu nuclei use xcyt use a mous pointer the user draw the approxim boundari of each nucleu use a comput vision approach known as snake these approxim then converg to the exact nuclear boundari thi interact process take between two and five minut per slide here is an imag show xcyt in use onc all or most of the nuclei have been isol in thi fasion

take advantag of the uniqu opportun avail for queri optim and evalu integr sequenc data with relat data so that user can store and queri a combin of relat and sequenc these requir serv as the goal of the seq project variou kind of sequenc need to be support tempor sequenc be the most import kind queri should be express use notion like next and previou which are natur when consid sequenc these queri should be optim so that they can be evalu effici these issu need to be studi in theori and then a databas system need to be built that demonstr the feasibl of the theoret idea project statu the current statu of the project is we have defin the seq data model that can support most import kind of sequenc data we have also defin algebra queri oper that can be compos to form sequenc queri analog to the composit of relat algebra oper to form relat queri we have describ how sequenc queri can be effici process and have identifi variou optim techniqu we use a sequenc queri languag sequin that can declar express queri over sequenc a sequin queri can includ embed express in a relat queri languag like sql or vice versa we are build a disk base databas system to demonstr the feasibl of our propos the system implement the seq model use a nest complex object architectur it is built over the shore storag manag and can process sever megabyt of data relat and sequenc are support in an integr and extens manner motiv exampl of a sequenc queri a weather monitor system record inform about variou meteorolog phenomena there is a sequenti in the occurr of these phenomena the variou meteorolog event are sequenc by the time at which they are record a scientist ask the queri for which volcano erupt did the most recent earthquak have a strength greater than on the richter scale if thi queri is to be express in a relat queri languag like sql complex featur like groupbi claus correl subqueri and aggreg function are requir further a convent relat queri optim would not find an effici queri execut plan even given the knowledg that the earthquak and volcano relat are sort by time howev a veri effici plan exist if one model the data as sequenc order by time the two sequenc can be scan in lock step similar to a sort merg join the most recent earthquak record scan can be store in a temporari buffer whenev a volcano record is process the valu of the most recent earthquak record store in the buffer is check to see if it strength wa greater than possibl gener an answer thi queri can therefor be process with a singl scan of the two sequenc and use veri littl memori the key to such optim is the sequenti of the data and the queri data model the detail of the seq data model are describ in a publish paper click here for postscript version here we present the gist of it the basic model of a sequenc is a set of record map to an order domain of posit thi mani to mani relationship between record and posit can be view in two dual but distinct way as a set of record map to each posit or as a set of posit map to each record these two view are call posit and record orient respect and each give rise to a set of queri oper base on that view queri on sequenc could requir oper of either or both flavor the record orient oper are similar to relat oper and includ variou kind of join overlap contain etc and aggreg such oper have been extens explor by research in the tempor databas commun the posit oper includ next previou offset move aggreg etc further oper allow zoom oper on sequenc by mean of collaps and expand the order domain associ with the sequenc for instanc a daili sequenc could be zoom out i e collaps to a weekli sequenc or zoom in i e expand to an hourli sequenc the last part of the model deal with oper on group i e set of sequenc the advantag is that thi make it easi to model queri involv sequenc collect which is the case in mani real world situat all the sequenc oper are extend to work with group of similar sequenc instead of with singl sequenc thi extens of the seq model indic that a practic implement of seq would probabl involv a nest complex object system sequin queri languag we have devis a queri languag call sequin use which declar sequenc queri can be
